    "\n",
    "For this session we are going to start by improving the performance of an existing CUDA program [`boxblur.cu`](./boxblur.ci) (you can open the file in the jupyter-lab editor by clicking on it). The starting code provided contains an implementation of a simple box blur. The box blur (also known as a box linear filter) is an operation which samples neighbouring pixels of an input image to output an average value. When applied iteratively to an image, the box filter can be used to approximate a more complicated Gaussian blur ([wiki link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_blur)). The box blur can be described as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Out_{x,y}=\\frac{I_{x-1,y-1} +I_{x,y-1} +I_{x+1,y-1} +I_{x-1,y} +I_{x,y} +I_{x+1,y} +I_{x-1,y+1} +I_{x,y+1} +I_{x+1,y+1}}{9} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the implementation provided, the box blur has the property that outside of the bounds of the input image values are `0`. The code works for fixed sized square images. An image `input.ppm` is provided in the ppm format and code is provided for image reading and writing. You can use your own image but make sure that the `IMAGE_SIZE` macro is changed to reflect your image size.\n",

    "*Figure 1 - Result of applying the Box filter for 0, 50 and 100 iterations on a photograph of the trainers dog (note: he looks cuter than he is...)*\n",
    "\n",
    "Try compiling and running the code using the code cells below (or via a jupyter-lab Terminal) and examine the output of the blurred image. Make a note of the execution time reported.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: The pre-processer declaration (`-D`) in the compilation is used to change code paths so that different versions of the main box blur loop can be easily switched between. Examine the starting code so that you can see where the switch takes place within the `main` function. There is a seperate switch case for each exercise in this lab.*\n",

    "The `image_blur_columns kernel` currently has a poor memory access pattern. Let us consider why this is. For each thread which is launched the thread iterates over a unique row of `IMAGE_DIM` pixels to perform the blurring on each pixel. Between each thread this creates a stride of `IMAGE_DIM` between memory loads. CUDA code is much more efficient when sequential threads read from sequential values in memory (memory coalescing). To improve the code, we can implement a row wise version on the kernel by completing the following."
