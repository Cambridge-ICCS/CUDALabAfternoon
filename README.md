# Introduction to CUDA Lab

Accelerators such as GPUs are prevalent both within personal computing as well as within high performance computing systems. Compared with traditional CPU architectures, performance is leveraged through a design which favours a high number of parallel compute cores at the expense of imposing significant software challenges. 

This introductory lab is designed to follow lectures which provide some insight into GPU architectures and insight into developing GPU code using CUDA.

To get started you will need a Python environment with the `jupyterlab` package installed. The preferred method is to install this inside a [virtual environment](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/).

You can then launch the notebook using

```
jupyter-lab LabExercise.ipynb
```
